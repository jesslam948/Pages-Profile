### My Beginnings
I've always loved puzzles, the challenge and process of problem solving. So, when I started learning how to code, I knew that this was something I wanted to do for as long as possible.

Later in high school, I got my first sneak peek in the world of cybersecurity when I participated in CyberPatriot, a cybersecurity competition run by the AFA. There was such a high learning curve and I struggled, a lot, but the challenge enticed me.

Now, I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Science at UCSD and aspire to combine my passion for computer science and cybersecurity in my future career!

### Fun Facts
1. I've spent hours upon hours upon hours playing Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley
    - I started with AC: Wild World, then played AC: New Leaf, and am now playing AC: New Horizons! I've probably logged wayyyy too many hours on these 3 games alone
    - I was introduced to SV this past year and am already on Summer Year 2 of my farm! I switch between playing casually and going hard-core haha
2. I love love love art
    - I especially love works created by modern artists like Yayoi Kusama, Takashi Murakami, and Olafur Eliasson
    - I spent 4 hours walking around the Louvre by myself!... And somehow still managed to not see everything :(
3. I participated in marching band for all 4 years of high school
    - I was in percussion (drums and mallet instruments) and especially loved an instrument called the marimba
    - I also learned and performed a different marimba solo each year (maybe a video or two are still floating out there...)
